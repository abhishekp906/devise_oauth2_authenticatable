= devise_oauth2_authenticatable

This is the basic framework for an OAuth2 gem for Devise. 

It currently works with FacebookGraph, to get started begin by registering a new application at

  http://developers.facebook.com/setup/
  
  
  
A generator is provided for creating your oauth yml file

script/generate devise_oauth2_authenticatable

Ex: 

script/generate devise_oauth2_authenticatable --id API_ID --key SECRET --server  https://graph.facebook.com --scope 'email,offline_access,publish_stream'







for more details
  
http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/



It's based on the devise facebook gem provided by grimen

  http://github.com/grimen/devise_facebook_connectable




And uses the example provided in OAuth2 library provided by mbleigh

  http://github.com/intridea/oauth2






DB Migration : 

    add_column :users, :oauth2_uid, :integer, :limit => 8  # BIGINT unsigned / 64-bit int
    add_column :users, :oauth2_token, :string, :limit => 149  # [128][1][20] chars
    add_index :users, :oauth2_uid, :unique => true



Note:

A little souce of confusion when working with Facebook Graph

The api key and secret key are no the same a Facebook Connect/the old API. 

The client id should be your application id and the client_key, should be your API key (not secret key)


== TODO

Write tests : 
  Currently no tests have been written. My bad. 

Add Javascript / token based auth :
  Facebook graph offes a complete authorization solution using javascript and a returned authentication token. Adding optional support for this would complete the Facebook Graph authentication interface. 
  
Generalize for OAuth2:
  Add support for other OAuth2 services. Wrote this specifically for facebook graph, athought configuration arugments should be generalized to support other interfaces. 



Description goes here.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
